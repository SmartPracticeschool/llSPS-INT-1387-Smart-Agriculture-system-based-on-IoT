Smart Agriculture system based on IoT

Hi there,

So this repository is all about my work realted to the project "Smart Agriculture system based on IoT"

I've added various screenshots taken at various steps in my progress, of the resources I've used.
There's a json file named "TSB internship - Node-Red flows.json" which include my node-red's flow code which I've used to build the UI 

I've also added a project report and project scope document in pdf form.

Also, there's a Powerpoint Presentation added by the name "PPT Smart Agriculture System using IoT.pptx"
And the explanation video's link is provided in the "Presentation Explanation Video" file.
